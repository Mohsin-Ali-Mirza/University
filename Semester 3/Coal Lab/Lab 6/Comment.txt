Dear Students,


Please note the following things while doing tasks of lab 6.


1. Task 1:
You need to reproduce the exact screen that is shown, including the text lines and colors
For color we had discussed the procedure in the previous lab 5.


Hint:
mov eax, foreground color+ (background color  * 16)
call SetTextColor
call clrscr


for delay:
mov eax,  value in milliseconds
call delay


Also generate the input lines.


2. Task 2:


In task 2 screen locations need to be random for that make sure that row value and col values are random and random value does not exceed max  possible value of your console window
Hint :
Declare two variables for row and col . Get max value of row and col possible on your console window using :


call GetMaxXY ;  row value is saved in ax and col in dx, 
save these values in  variables declared earlier and later use them for setting the max possible value of random number/ range.
