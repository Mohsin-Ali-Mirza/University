Sir what does
"if the advanced loads are overwritten, we are no worse than
before!" means in Prefetching slides ?

It means that whatever logic or predictive algorithm we apply to decide what to prefetch it needs to be accurate because if that is not the cause we will never use the prefetched data hence going back to square one.

Prefetching for Latency Hiding:
• Misses on loads cause programs to stall.
• Why not advance the loads so that by the time the data is actually needed, it is already there!
{Pre-fetching bring the adjacent data (size of cache line) in the background. NK}
• The only drawback is that you might need more space to store advanced loads.
{Yes. Now we store 1024 cache lines instead of 1024 words. NK}
• However, if the advanced loads are overwritten, we are no worse than before!
{The cache line might be overwritten by some other thread and need to bring in again. NK}
