Suppose a significant weblog is stored on an HDFS as a CSV file. This file has the following fields per line: hostname, host IP address, timestamp, browser name (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Edge), URL requested, and amount of data sent.

Submit handwritten Map and Reduce functions for all three options on one side of an A4 page.
Note. See the attached C code file to write the functions as guided in today's lab.


a) How much data is requested per unique URL? The output file contains the URL and total data requested.
b) Which host provided the URL to the user? The output file contains the hostname and a list of URLs.
c) Count the number of hosts in the cluster. The output file contains the sentence "This cluster consists of 250 hosts".

**Submission which does not follow the guideline will be ignored.
