Q. sir, what does amortizing the latency across various accesses mean? (week4 hiding memory latency slide).

A. in simple words, we try to make a queue of threads waiting for a memory operation to complete (each one will be preempted by the schedular after doing memory read), instead of serialized access to memory if the same code is put in one thread. This situation put the memory system in continuous operation at its peak.
