ompCritical.cpp, ompFor.cpp, ompForSchedule.cpp are provided as a template, to help you see GitHub code. Our goal is to run both types of scheduling on loop iterations 100K (probably of different chunk sizes). You can use code from your previous submissions and add scheduling to lean and submit the results.
