Write an OpenMP C program to perform the mathematical operation (multiply, divide, etc.) on each element of an array of 100K+ elements of double values.
Use critical pragma to sum the elements of the array.
The master thread should print the sum.
Write and execute your program for 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 20, 100, and 200 threads.
Submit your results using screen captures and a single .c file.
DO NOT submit zip files.
Ask questions by posting comments.
Question: How are a group of C statements inside a parallel block executed only by a single thread?
Hint: Try to find an OpenMP #pragma as a solution.
